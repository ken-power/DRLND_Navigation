## Learning Algorithm
This section describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for the neural networks.

## Plot of Rewards
This section contains a plot of rewards per episode and illustrates that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13. 

The number of episodes needed to solve the environment is `x`.

## Ideas for Future Work
This section contains ideas for future work to improve the agent's performance
